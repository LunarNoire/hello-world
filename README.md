# hello-world
An introduction about myself and my goals.
I'm currently a nurse and have been in the medical field since a teen. I'm now ready to move on because although I love taking care of others, I have seen too much that I am not comfortable with and I feel like nursing has become repetitive and tedious and doesn't allow me to express my creativity. I chose to learn coding because I've always enjoyed computers, technology in general, and the flexibility to create. I would also like to learn backend development to create a more efficient program for medical professionals with a focus on ease of use and understanding from the completely computer illiterate to the professional. I've worked with a few programs such as PCC, Matrix, and ECS and would like to create a program that takes the best of each of these and create something more satisfying UX that can increase productivety by streamlining some of the functions into a better program. I'm always amazed at the development of new apps and websites and have ideas that I'd like to see come to life. I'd like to break out of my shell and meet new people with the same interest in coding.
